#TASK 0
The worst case scenario of the task is constant O(1), the index of the item is known so it can be accessed directly regardless of the number of items in the list.

#TASK 1
The worst case scenario of this task is O(2n) + O(2n) + O(2) = O(4n + 2), the runtime of the program will increase with the size of input.
As n becomes larger The final complexity of the algorithm will be O(n).

#TASK 2
The worst case scenario of this task is O(n) + O(7) + O(n ^ 2) + O(7) = O(n^2 + n + 14),
the runtime will increase considerable as input increases because of the outer and inner loops.
The final complexity of the algorithm will be O(n^2).

#TASK 3
The worst case scenario of this task is O(4n) + O(7) = O(4n + 7), the runtime of the program will increase linearly with the size of input.
As n becomes larger The final complexity of the algorithm will be O(n).


#TASK 4
The worst case scenario of this task is O(6n) + O(2) = O(6n + 2), the runtime of the program will increase linearly with the size of input.
As n becomes larger The final complexity of the algorithm will be O(n).
